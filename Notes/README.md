# Notes — Quick References

This folder contains short notes and quick-reference materials useful for system design, microservices, REST architecture, Git tips, and a cheat sheet with commands and common patterns.

## Purpose
- Centralize short, focused notes for quick review during interview prep.
- Provide clickable links to open each file directly from your editor or GitHub.

## Files
- [Cheat Sheet (PDF)](Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
- [Git — Notes](Git.md)
- [Microservices — Notes](Microservices.md)
- [RESTful Architecture — Notes](RESTfulArchitecture.md)

## Suggested quick-read order
1. `Cheat_Sheet.pdf` — fast refresh before mock interviews.
2. `RESTfulArchitecture.md` — API design fundamentals.
3. `Microservices.md` — system-level design considerations.
4. `Git.md` — version control workflows and commands.

## Usage
- Click any link in the README from your editor's Markdown preview to open the file directly.
- Keep these notes lightweight — prefer links to full books in `External Resources` for deeper reading.
