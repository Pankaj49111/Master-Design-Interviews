# LLD Prep — Low-Level Design Practice

This folder collects low-level design (LLD) exercises, worked examples, and solutions used for interview preparation and practice. Each subfolder contains one or more problem write-ups, diagrams, code sketches, or test cases.

Plan / checklist
- List the contents so you can quickly jump into a topic.
- Provide short descriptions and suggested order for practice.
- Make folder links clickable so you can open them from the README.

## Structure
Below are the subfolders and files in this folder. Click a link to open the directory or file in your editor/Markdown viewer.

- [Design Patterns 2025/](Design%20Patterns%202025/README.md)
  - Notes, examples and exercises on common design patterns (updated 2025).

- [DesignATM/](DesignATM/README.md)
  - Low-level design for an ATM (classes, state, transactions, error handling).

- [DesignBookMyShow/](DesignBookMyShow/README.md)
  - LLD for a ticket booking system: seat allocation, concurrency considerations, and APIs.

- [DesignDataStructures/](DesignDataStructures/README.md)
  - Problem-focused data structure designs and implementations.

- [DesignOrderManagementSystem/](DesignOrderManagementSystem/README.md)
  - Order lifecycle, state transitions, and component responsibilities for OMS.

- [DesignPatterns/](DesignPatterns/README.md)
  - Additional pattern examples and older notes (complementary to the 2025 folder).

- [DesignSplitwise/](DesignSplitwise/README.md)
  - Expense splitting and balance tracking LLD with sample models.

- [DesignVendingMachine/](DesignVendingMachine/README.md)
  - Vending machine LLD covering inventory, payment, and maintenance flows.

- [HandleNullObject/](HandleNullObject/README.md)
  - Example demonstrating the Null Object pattern and alternatives.

- [LLDCarRentalSystem/](LLDCarRentalSystem/README.md)
  - Car rental service design: bookings, inventory, pricing, and edge cases.

- [LLDCricbuzz/](LLDCricbuzz/README.md)
  - LLD for a live score / cricket updates system with event models and streaming considerations.

- [LLDElevatorDesign/](LLDElevatorDesign/README.md)
  - Controller logic, scheduling algorithms, and prioritization strategies for elevator systems.

- [LLDSnakeLadder/](LLDSnakeLadder/README.md)
  - Game design example with state machine and turn handling.

- [LLDTicTacToe/](LLDTicTacToe/README.md)
  - Simple game LLD with validation, win detection, and move history.

- [problemSolutions.md](problemSolutions.md)
  - Collected solutions and notes that tie multiple exercises together.

## Suggested practice order
1. `DesignPatterns/` or `Design Patterns 2025/` — refresh common patterns.
2. `DesignDataStructures/` and `problemSolutions.md` — core data structure designs.
3. Pick 2–3 system exercises (e.g., `DesignATM/`, `DesignVendingMachine/`, `LLDCarRentalSystem/`) and implement a class model + basic tests.
4. Move to concurrency and scheduling problems (`LLDElevatorDesign/`, `DesignBookMyShow/`).

## Usage notes
- Click any link in the README from your editor's Markdown preview to open the folder or file. Most editors will open directory views or files directly.
- Use `problemSolutions.md` as the canonical place for final answers and cross-references.

## Contribution
To add or update an exercise:
1. Create a new folder here with a descriptive name.
2. Add a README inside the new folder describing the exercise, requirements, and expected deliverables.
3. Add your solution files and update `problemSolutions.md` with a short summary.
