# Master Design Interviews — Study Workspace

This top-level README documents the `Master Design Interviews` collection: curated resources, low-level design exercises, and concise notes used for interview preparation and practice.

## Purpose
- Provide an entry point and navigation for the materials in this workspace.
- Offer a suggested study path and contribution guidance.

## Table of contents
- [External Resources](External%20Resources/README.md)
- [LLD Prep — Low-Level Design](LLD%20Prep/README.md)
- [Notes — Quick References](Notes/README.md)
- [Suggested study path](#suggested-study-path)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Contribution](#contribution)
- [License & Copyright](#license--copyright)

## Overview of folders

- External Resources
  - A collection of third-party books and archives (PDFs) for deep dives: system design, distributed systems, databases, and interview collections.
  - Open the folder README for a clickable list of included books and recommended reading order: [External Resources README](External%20Resources/README.md)

- LLD Prep
  - Low-level design exercises, worked examples, and solutions organized by problem (ATM, Vending Machine, Car Rental, Elevator, etc.).
  - Open the folder README to jump into exercises and their READMEs: [LLD Prep README](LLD%20Prep/README.md)

- Notes
  - Short, focused notes and cheat sheets (Git, Microservices, RESTful Architecture) for quick review before interviews.
  - Open the folder README for quick links: [Notes README](Notes/README.md)

## Suggested study path
1. Quick refresh: `Notes` (Cheat sheet, REST/API fundamentals, Git workflows).
2. Design patterns and fundamentals: `LLD Prep` → `Design Patterns 2025` and `DesignDataStructures`.
3. Implement and practice: pick 2–3 LLD exercises (e.g., `DesignATM`, `DesignVendingMachine`, `LLDCarRentalSystem`) and write class models + tests.
4. System-level thinking: `External Resources` — read selected chapters (start with `Designing Data-Intensive Applications`, `Designing Distributed Systems`).
5. Interview practice: use `External Resources` archives (ByteByteGo, Grokking, Alex Xu) and `LLD Prep` problems for mock interviews.

## High-priority resources (direct links)

Jump straight to key books without navigating through folders:

- 🎯 **[Cracking the Coding Interview](External%20Resources/Cracking_the_Coding_Interview_189_Programming_Questions_and_Solutions.pdf)** — algorithms & data structures
- 🧩 **[Head First Design Patterns](External%20Resources/01%20OReilly%20Head%20First%20-%20Head%20First%20Design%20Patterns%20-%20Freeman.pdf)** — pattern fundamentals
- 🛠️ **[Database Internals](External%20Resources/Database%20Internals.pdf)** — storage engines & indexing
- 📘 **[Grokking the System Design Interview](External%20Resources/Grokking-the-system-design-interviewpdf-5-pdf-free%20%281%29.pdf)** — interview practice
- 🔗 **[ByteByteGo Big Archive (2024)](External%20Resources/ByteByteGo-System%20Design%20Big%20Archive%202024.pdf)** — latest problems & solutions

For a complete list with descriptions, see [External Resources README](External%20Resources/README.md).

## Usage
- Click the folder links above from this README in your editor or on GitHub to open the folder README or files.
- Prefer the README in each folder as the canonical navigator for that topic.

## Contribution
- To add a new resource or exercise:
  1. Add the file/folder under the appropriate folder (e.g., `LLD Prep/YourExercise/`).
  2. Add a brief `README.md` in the new folder describing the exercise and expected deliverables.
  3. Update the relevant folder `README.md` and optionally this top-level README if the change affects the overall structure.
